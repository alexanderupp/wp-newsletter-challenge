# WordPress Newsletter Challenge

This was originally built as a coding/technical challenge for a previous interview. You will need at least PHP version 8.0 to run the plugin. The requirements were to build a newsletter sign-up form that could appear inline on specific pages, or across the entire site. The sign-ups would then be saved as a custom "Subscriber" post type.


## Installation

Zip up the directory called "wp-newsletter-challenge" and upload the file to your WordPress site via the new plugin function:

Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin

Or you can directly upload the "wp-newsletter-challenge" directory to the "wp-plugins" directory on your site.

Once activated you can play around with the plugin's settings via the link in the left-side Admin Menu:

Settings > Newsletter Form


## Features

- Multiple form accent colors
- Shortcode for inline newsletter forms
- Popup form for all pages (can be enabled/disabled)
- Option for which side of the popup the graphic appears (graphic can be hidden) 
- Ability to change form text
